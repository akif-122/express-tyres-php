                <h2 class="text-center">About Us</h2>

                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>At <strong>XPRESS TYRES LTD</strong>., we have a very fundamental philosophy that guides us: we
                        aim to provide 100% customer satisfaction by ensuring quality products and excellent services.
                    </p>


                    <p>In Manchester, we are one of the leading suppliers of fresh tyres from major manufacturing
                        companies around the world. We excel in tyre fitment services as well.</p>

                    <p>At our facility, we aim to serve the people who live in or around Manchester with quality
                        products for car tyres and van tyres. We also ensure there is a fit for every clientâ€™s
                        requirements, no matter the budget. Hence, our product range comprises premium brands, mid-range
                        brands, as well as budget brands.</p>

                    <h4>Tyres we sell</h4>

                    <p>We are the authorised retailers of iconic tyre brands like Continental, Bridgestone, Goodyear,
                        Pirelli, Michelin, and Dunlop, whereas we also deal in budget brands such as Compass, Debica,
                        Goalstar, Minerva, Nordex, Torque, and more.</p>

                    <p>We sell almost all the models that these manufacturers have on offer in their arsenal. From
                        standard summer and winter models to UHP and run-flat tyres, you are sure to find every type at
                        our facility.</p>

                    <p>We also retail budget and premium tyres at special prices for our clients. Our inventory has a
                        wide range of specialised models for SUVs, all-terrain vehicles, vans, and other heavy vehicles.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Tyre fitment services</h4>

                    <p>Tyre fitting is a professional job that requires years of experience. Even a single mistake can
                        spell risks on-road. Safety is the obvious concern; prolonged periods of snow or rain are quite
                        common in the UK. Under such circumstances, properly fitted tyres are nothing less than
                        mandatory.</p>

                    <p>At <strong>XPRESS TYRES LTD</strong>., our team uses the latest available technologies for a
                        precision tyre fitment service. It will bring you further comfort to know that we also offer
                        expert services for wheel balancing and tyre puncture repair.</p>

                    <p>Our multiple service bays are also helpful in fitting multiple cars simultaneously. Note that our
                        service garage in Manchester used mostly automated technologies to fit tyres, leaving very
                        little room for errors. Also, our tyre fitment services are priced competitively</p>

                    <h4>Our mission</h4>
                    <p>Our mission is to become the most reliable and technologically advanced car service station in
                        Manchester and adjacent areas, to begin with. We aim to become one of the biggest names in this
                        segment in the United Kingdom.</p>

                    <h4>Our vision</h4>
                    <p>We envision a future where XPRESS TYRES LTD. in Manchester will be a one-stop destination for all
                        car owners in this part of the UK. We are committed to improving with evolving technologies and
